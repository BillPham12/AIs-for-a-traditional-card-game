<p>If players name is on red, that means the current turn of the game is on that player.
In the picture above, the current turn is bill and players' score is the number below their name.
On the right hand side is the console log to help users remember cards played in a single game.
the console log will be automatically renew each game.</p>

<p>To play cards, users just need to click on the card they want to play such as the picture below.
And click play or pass. You are not allowed to undo your move. </p>

<p>Users are allowed to play 3 invalid melds in a single turn. In other words, they will lose their turn
  if they play 3 invalid melds in a row.</p>
